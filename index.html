            Hey Baby,<br/><br/>
            I’d like to think that our love story was scripted before time began, and I would be right – because very recently, I was reminded (in Church) that if God planned the redemption of man, before we were created, then the minutiae of our lives have been planned before we ever existed. So, our love story is definitely a fact of predestination. We are not happenstance, we are not a one-in-a-million possibility, our love is, was, and will always be a certainty. If we were an exercise in probability, our love would be the constant in the equation, because we are defiantly definitive – meant to be against all odds.          
          </p><br/>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            What it means to me that we are together isn’t something I will ever be able to adequately express in words. What is to be said about my love for you that will ever suffice? I exist in your world, and you exist in mine as a presence and a complete occupation. I am completely enamored by you and totally obsessed with you. I love you consciously in every possible way.
          </p><br/>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            The reason I try to be as intentional as I can with how much we spend time talking and expressing our love and appreciation for each other – in words and action – is because I know that we won’t always have this. So now when it’s still intoxicating, and obsessive, let’s spend every minute getting drunk on each other’s love. Let’s curate experiences for ourselves. Let’s gift ourselves with memories that would last several lifetimes and transcend time. Let’s experience ourselves in new lights every day. Let’s obsess over each other like an insatiable longing. Let’s taste love each day like water turned to wine, better than the day before, and wondering where was this level yesterday? Ugh! An eternity of endlessly incremental experiences of love. We can never be just another couple in love, we are THAT couple that’s the envy of all eyes.
          </p><br/>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            The other day I joked about everyday (including February 24th) being for God (which it is), but February 14th will also be our day, and I never want you to go into any Valentine’s Day in any year, thinking about anything but us. Every day may be Valentine’s but February 14th, will be something else – I really don’t think the world is ready for us baby. <br/><br/>
            <b>My manifesto is</b><br/>
            To be your retirement plan<br/>
            To be your provider and bank<br/>
            To be your trip sponsor and event planner<br/>
            To be your fighter<br/>
            To give you the world and heaven in it<br/>
            To show you dimensions of love that nobody knew could be humanly reached<br/>
            To worship you everyday<br/>
            To blow your mind till it is impossible for anything to surprise you but me<br/>
            To take you to Palawan, Sardinia, Tahiti, and Bora Bora then take you to Mars when SpaceX makes these flight commercially available<br/>
            To do romance with you till we’re in heaven, and get a pass from God so I can continue to love you for all eternity<br/>
            To be the entire world for you and so much more<br/>
            I’ll close with this short poem I wrote on the 25th of November 2020 – exactly 4 years before our first phone call
          </p><br/>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <i>
              There’s a certain state of mind in my head<br/>
              It’s like a moment in a picture<br/>
              It has music playing in the background<br/>
              I’m in a warm hug with my love<br/>
              The colour is sepia<br/>
              Time is passing<br/>
              But in that moment<br/>
              We are all we know<br/>
              Our love is a presence<br/>
            </i>
          </p><br/>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            I can’t wait to frame this piece of poetry into a memory with you.<br/>
            I love you in time and for all eternity<br/>
            My eternal love, Sig ❤<br/>
